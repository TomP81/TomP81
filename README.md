### ðŸ‘‹ Hi everyone!

My name is Thomas, and I'm passionate about programming, data science, and artificial intelligence. I learned the Python language, which led me to become interested in the field of Machine Learning. Prior to that, I had knowledge in DAO and 3D modeling.

ðŸŽ“ I completed a project as part of my training at Le Wagon training center. It's a predictor of trail duration, with both a back-end and front-end.

ðŸ’» After completing a Python training, I enrolled in the Data Science bootcamp at Le Wagon. I learned SQL as well as all the tools such as Pandas, SciPy, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.

ðŸš€ I enjoy creating things and making them functional, evolving things, and contributing to project advancement. I'm motivated to learn from others by participating in collaborative or open-source projects, for example.

ðŸ‘¤ I'm interested in joining exciting projects in a team or in open-source.

Feel free to contact me if you have any interesting projects or if you'd like to discuss my skills and past projects.
